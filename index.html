    <p><a href="https://www.example.com/projects/index.html " target="_blank">Title Not Decided</Title></title></a> Title Not Decided was founded in 2020 with a mission to create skilled Software Engineers for our country and the world. We are here to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and the quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes.</p>
    <h1 id="h3">Make People Fall in Love with Coding</h1>
    <p>Programming is a lot of fun because, unlike other subjects, you get to instantly apply the concepts you are learning. At Coding Blocks, we strive to increase student interest by providing hands on practical training on every concept taught in the classroom.</p>
    <h1 id="h4">Unlock New Opportunities</h1>
    <p>We create confident developers who think beyond industrial jobs and march their ideas into self-created entrepreneurship ventures. Skill and innovative thinking give developers the confidence to transform their ideas into real life products and hopefully go on to build million dollar companies.</p>
    <h1 id="h5">Connect Talent with Employers</h1>
    <p>Along with training students with the latest technologies and programming languages, we also connect them to software companies via our placement assistance program. This program includes practicing a lot of interview problems and mock interviews conducted by company representatives.</p>
